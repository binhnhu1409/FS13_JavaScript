5. Provide logic for function generateNewFolderName, which receive an array as argument. Everytime the function gets called,

6. Complete class Book:
- class Book should have 3 properties: title (read-only, must be a string but cannot be empty), cost (private, must be positive number) and profit (private, positive number > 0 and =< 0.5)
(error should be thrown if data is not valid)
- give the logic to get book's price and profit separately.
- give the logics to increase and decrease the price with a certain amount 
- give the logic to calculate price based on cost and profit. For example: cost 14, profit 0.3 => expected price is 20.

Complete class TaxableBook: 
- inherit Book, but have 1 more private parameter in the constructor: taxRate. 
- give the logic to calculate price with taxRate. For example: 
cost 14, profit 0.3 , tax 24% => expected price is 30.43
